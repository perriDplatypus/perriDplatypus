I am Abhay. I am a programmer from Melbourne, Australia.

### What I do:
I am a software developer with a special focus on SQL Server Databases Development and Administration. I have 3 years of experience in the industry and have been programming since 2011.

### What else do I do:
Honestly I don't know. I play video games, play guitar, and go on long walks.

### Why I do it:
Because coding is fun and creating stuff is fun. I also love trying to get under the hood with stuff that interests me. I love low level code and mainly like focusing on back end development but I do delve into front end development time to time.

### Contributions
I would love to contribute to a project. I have contributed to a few open source projects but I am keen to work on more. You can reach me on abhaytyagi2513@gmail.com.
